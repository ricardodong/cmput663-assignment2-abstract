StackOverflow is one of the most popular online discussion forums to about programming problems. 
Usually, StackOvarflow posts contains two different kinds of blocks: text blocks and code blocks.
In text blocks, users provide questions, answers, and explanations in natural language text. 
In the code blocks, users provide actual codes or commands to provide the detailed situations or solutions.
However, usually, users include simple codes or commands into text blocks as in-line codes. 
These in-line codes contain crucial information but are not distinguished from other natural language sentences. 
Therefore, when mining codes from StackOverflow data, those in-line codes are often missed. 
This paper presents an approach to distinguish in-line codes in text blocks by using a simple language model. 
We use SOTorrent, which is a torrent data obtained from StackOverflow dump data, to extract both text blocks and code blocks. 
For the evaluation, due to the lack of labelled StackOverflow dataset, we also manually labelled extracted text data to create development and test datasets.
